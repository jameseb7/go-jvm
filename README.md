go-jvm
======

A simple JVM written in Go. I'm intending to write something capable of interpreting Java bytecode, mostly as a means to better understand Java bytecode. Given that goal, I'm not intending to implement JIT compilation and I will be using Go's garbage collector rather than implementing my own.
